# Config
#### Mac OS High Sierra

**Config** is my checklist I follow to set up a new Mac's development environment. It gets me up to speed with Homebrew, Git, Node, GitHub, and more so I can more quickly get back to work.

## Contents

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.gitconfig` | Global Git configuration to specify my name and email, shortcuts, colors, and more. |
| `.gitignore` | The ignore file from [twbs/bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) that I use everywhere. |ïœ€

## Checklist

### 1. Prep OS X

- Enter `xcode-select --install` in a Terminal window.

OR

- Download and install latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store.
